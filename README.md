##Installation

To use Alfred 2 extensions you need the Alfred powerpack.
Download the workflow, that's how Alfred extensions are called, [here](http://glumb.de/files/special-characters.alfredworkflow).  
Double click the file. This will open Alfred and import the workflow. 

##Usage

To see a list of all characters simply type `char` followed by a blank.
Searching for a character works as expected by typing `char {query}`.  
The *query* can be the name or type of the character. For example *math* or  *greek delta*.

Select a result item by pressing enter, to copy the character to the clipboard.
